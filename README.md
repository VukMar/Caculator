# VukMar Calculator v1.0.0

VukMar Calculator is a simple calculator program.

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the VukMar Calculator v1.0.0. The programm is written in C++ with SFML library.

The calculator can perform all operations and keep track of the done operations. 
The operation is calculated when numbers are entered, but the result is only saved when the `=` is clicked.

This was my practice project when i was starting out with C++ and SFML.
